# Go Event Booking REST API

A simple event booking REST API built with Go, Gin, SQLite, and JWT authentication. It supports user signup/login, CRUD for events, and event registrations.

- **Framework**: Gin (`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`)
- **Database**: SQLite (`github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`)
- **Auth**: JWT (`github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5`)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt (`golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`)
- **Go Version**: declared in `go.mod` (`go 1.24.x`)

## How it works

- The server starts in `main.go` on port `:8080` and calls `db.InitDB()` which:
  - Opens/creates `api.db` (SQLite)
  - Creates tables `users`, `events`, and `registrations` if missing (`db/db.go`)
- Routes are registered in `routes/routes.go`.
  - Public: `GET /events`, `GET /events/:id`, `POST /signup`, `POST /login`
  - Authenticated: `POST /events`, `PUT /events/:id`, `DELETE /events/:id`, `POST /events/:id/register`, `DELETE /events/:id/register`
- Auth middleware (`middlewares/auth.go`) expects an `Authorization` header containing the raw JWT token string. Note: it does not parse the `Bearer` prefix.
- Passwords are hashed via bcrypt in `utils/hash.go`.
- JWT tokens are generated/verified in `utils/jwt.go` (HS256). Default secret is hardcoded as `supersecret`.

---

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+

### Install dependencies
```
go mod tidy
```

### Run the server
```
go run ./...
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

A local SQLite DB file `api.db` will be created in the project root with the required tables.

---

## Configuration

- JWT Secret: defined in `utils/jwt.go` as `const secretKey = "supersecret"`.
  - For production, change this value and consider loading from environment variables.
- Port: hardcoded in `main.go` as `:8080`.
- Database: SQLite file `api.db` in the project root.

---

## Data Models

### Users (`users`)
- `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`
- `email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE`
- `password TEXT NOT NULL` (bcrypt hashed)

### Events (`events`)
- `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`
- `name TEXT NOT NULL`
- `description TEXT NOT NULL`
- `location TEXT NOT NULL`
- `dateTime DATETIME NOT NULL`
- `userId INTEGER` (creator/owner)

### Registrations (`registrations`)
- `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`
- `eventId INTEGER`
- `userId INTEGER`

---

## Authentication

- Sign up and login endpoints are public.
- After logging in, you receive a JWT (`HS256`) with claims: `email`, `userId`, `exp`.
- To access protected endpoints, send the token in the `Authorization` header.
  - Important: The middleware expects the raw token without `Bearer`.
  - Example: `Authorization: <token>`

---

## Request/Response Conventions

- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Date/time format for `Event.DateTime`: RFC3339 (example: `2025-09-28T12:00:00Z`)
- Errors are returned as JSON: `{"message": "..."}` with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Notes & Limitations

- The `Authorization` header expects the raw JWT token (no `Bearer` prefix) as per `middlewares/auth.go`.
- JWT secret is hardcoded (`utils/jwt.go`). For production, externalize to environment variables.
- No pagination or filtering on `GET /events`.
- Error messages and some status codes (e.g., `users.go` returns 200 on bad body) could be refined.
- No CORS configuration added; add as needed for browser clients.

---

## Development Tips

- Modify DB schema in `db/db.go` (or move to migrations tool if desired).
- Add validation layers as needed. Current binding tags exist in `models/event.go` and `models/user.go`, and are used via Gin's `ShouldBindJSON`/`ShouldBindBodyWithJSON`.
- Consider updating middleware to accept `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Replace the hardcoded JWT secret and port with environment variables.
